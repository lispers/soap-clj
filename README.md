# soap-clj

**This is not a library.**

This is a sample implementation of SOAP in Clojure without any additional framework using core Java features.

A quick intro about the steps in my blog post: https://prasans.info/2018/02/soap-call-in-clojure-compojure-with-saaj/

For this example i have used a public web service with SOAP endpoint. http://www.webservicex.net/geoipservice.asmx
